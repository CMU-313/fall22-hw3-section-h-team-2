# Description of feature

The feature our team built enables users tagged as reviewers to be assigned to applications (represented as single documents).

# How to use our feature

## Admin
- Navigate to *Reviewers* in Navbar
- Type the name of an existing user and click *Add* to tag them as reviewer. If you try to tag a user who does not exist, it will fail. If successful, the user will appear in the list of reviewers below

## Both User & Admin
- Under *Documents* in Navbar, you can see the list of users who have been tagged as reviewer
- To assign reviewers to applications, first click *Add a document* to upload an application. Under *Primary Data* -> *Reviewers*, type a reviewer and click on the reviewer you want to assign to this application in the dropdown menu
- Under *Additional metadata*, the fields *Skills*, *Experience* and *GPA* can also be filled in when uploading applications
